# 577 Employee Bonus

To find employees with a **bonus less than 1000**, we need to consider cases where an employee **has no bonus at all**.

### **Approach**
1. **Perform a `LEFT JOIN`**:
   - We join `Employee` and `Bonus` tables using `empID`:

   ```sql
   FROM Employee AS e
   LEFT JOIN Bonus AS b
   ON e.empID = b.empID
   ```
   - Since `Employee` contains all employees, the `LEFT JOIN` ensures that employees without a corresponding `Bonus` record will have **NULL** values in the `Bonus` column.

2. **Apply filtering condition**:
   - We need to select employees **where the bonus is either below 1000 or does not exist (NULL)**:

   ```sql
   WHERE b.bonus < 1000 OR b.bonus IS NULL
   ```

### **Conclusion**
This ensures that we correctly filter out all employees **whose bonus is either below 1000 or who have no bonus at all**.![img](https://api2.mubu.com/v3/document_image/30352914_6802bbc5-e841-42d5-c426-12b115bc62d3.png)
