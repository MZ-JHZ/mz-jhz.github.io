# 1280 Students and Examinations

To correctly list all students and their examination records, including subjects they did not take, we need to generate all possible student-subject combinations and count the number of exams taken for each.

### **Approach**
1. **Use a `CROSS JOIN` between `Students` and `Subjects`**:
   - This ensures that every student is paired with every possible subject.
   - This step is necessary because if a subject has no examination records in `Examinations`, it would be missing from the output.

   ```sql
   FROM Students AS s
   CROSS JOIN Subjects AS sub
   ```

2. **Perform a `LEFT JOIN` with `Examinations`**:
   - This allows us to retain all student-subject combinations while bringing in exam records where available.

   ```sql
   LEFT JOIN Examinations AS e
   ON s.student_id = e.student_id AND sub.subject_name = e.subject_name
   ```

3. **Use `GROUP BY` to count the number of exams taken**:
   - If a student has multiple records for the same subject, they will be counted.
   - If no exams were taken for a subject, the count will be `0`.

   ```sql
   GROUP BY s.student_id, s.student_name, sub.subject_name
   ```

### **Conclusion**
This method ensures that:
- All students and subjects are represented in the output.
- Subjects with no exams are correctly displayed with a count of `0`.
- Multiple exam records for a subject are aggregated properly.

This approach guarantees an accurate representation of student examination participation. ![img](https://api2.mubu.com/v3/document_image/30352914_3d351088-bed3-4009-8ca1-1484013dd2a9.png)![img](https://api2.mubu.com/v3/document_image/30352914_0f77d184-cc9d-4968-a9dc-26b5e0fde00d.png)![img](https://api2.mubu.com/v3/document_image/30352914_9e02a573-0be6-45e2-8b85-ec9192efa5df.png)
