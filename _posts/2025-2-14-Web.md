## **1. Clone the GitHub Repository**

- You used `git clone` to clone the `mz-jhz.github.io` repository from GitHub.
- This operation created a local folder (possibly `C:\Users\junha\github\mz-jhz.github.io`).

## **2. Open the Project in Atom**

- You opened the `mz-jhz.github.io` folder in Atom and made modifications (e.g., editing `_config.yml`).
- However, you noticed that **the file directory in Atom did not match the one in the terminal**.

## **3. Run the Jekyll Server**

- You ran the following command in the terminal:

  ```sh
  bundle exec jekyll serve
  ```

  - Jekyll successfully launched a local server and listened on `http://127.0.0.1:4000`.
  - However, when you accessed the webpage, you found that **the changes did not take effect**.

## **4. Identifying Discrepancies Between Atom and Local Files**

- You edited `_config.yml` in Atom but noticed that when running `cat _config.yml` in the terminal, **the contents did not match what you had edited**.
- After checking the local `mz-jhz.github.io` folder, you found that:
  - Some files deleted in Atom still existed (e.g., the `_posts` directory).
  - This indicated that **Atom might not be editing files in the correct directory, or multiple versions of the project exist**.

## **5. Troubleshooting the Issue**

- You opened Windows File Explorer and found that the `mz-jhz.github.io` folder still existed locally.
- You realized that **Atom might have opened two different project folders, causing discrepancies between what you saw and what you were actually editing**.
- You attempted to run the following command to rebuild the site:
  ```sh
  rm -rf _site && bundle exec jekyll build && bundle exec jekyll serve
  ```
  - However, the issue persisted.

## **How Was the Local `mz-jhz.github.io` Folder Created?**

Your local `mz-jhz.github.io` folder might have been created in the following ways:

1. **Generated by `git clone`**:
   - When you cloned the repository from GitHub, Git created the `mz-jhz.github.io` folder and synced all remote repository files.

2. **Generated by Jekyll's build process**:
   - The `_site/` directory is generated by Jekyll as the static website output. This is automatically created and **should not be edited directly**.

3. **Multiple instances of `mz-jhz.github.io` exist**:
   - You may have cloned the same repository in different locations, leading to Atom and the terminal referencing different directories.
