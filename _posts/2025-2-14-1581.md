# 1581 Customer Who Visited but Did Not Make Any Transaction

### **Understanding the Problem**
The goal is to identify customers who have visited but have **not made any transaction**. This means that their `amount` should be **NULL** in the `Transactions` table.

### **Approach**
1. **Use a `LEFT JOIN` between `Visits` and `Transactions`**:
   - Since we need to check all customers, we perform a **`LEFT JOIN`** on `visit_id`, ensuring that all customer visits are included, even if they have no transactions.

   ```sql
   FROM Visits AS v
   LEFT JOIN Transactions AS t
   ON v.visit_id = t.visit_id
   ```
   - This ensures that if a customer did not make any transactions, their `amount` will be **NULL**.

2. **Filter customers who have not made any transaction**:
   - We select only those **where `Transactions.amount` is NULL**, ensuring that no transactions were recorded.

   ```sql
   WHERE t.amount IS NULL
   ```

3. **Group by `customer_id` to count occurrences**:
   - Since we want to count how many times each customer **visited without making a transaction**, we use:

   ```sql
   GROUP BY v.customer_id
   ```
   - This groups visits by customer, ensuring that we count the number of times each customer **did not make a transaction**.

4. **Select relevant columns**:
   - We use `COUNT(*)` to count the number of times a customer did not make a transaction.

   ```sql
   SELECT v.customer_id, COUNT(*) AS no_transaction_visits
   ```

### **Conclusion**
By structuring the query in this way, we effectively identify customers who have **visited but never completed a transaction**, ensuring an accurate count of such instances.![img](https://api2.mubu.com/v3/document_image/30352914_1ac165f4-e322-4412-81b5-0de925df243d.png)
