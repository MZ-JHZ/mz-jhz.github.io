# 1661 Average Time of Process per Machine

### **Understanding the Problem**
This problem requires calculating the **average processing time per machine**, where each machine may have multiple processes with distinct `process_id`.

### **Key Observations**
- Although this problem is categorized under **JOIN**, I opted to use **subqueries** instead.
- The first level of grouping is based on `machine_id`, and the second level is `process_id`. Thus, the SQL must contain:

  ```sql
  GROUP BY machine_id, process_id
  ```

  This ensures that we correctly distinguish different processes within each machine.

### **Approach**
1. **Create a temporary table (`table_1`) to structure process start and end times**:
   - We extract `start` and `end` timestamps for each `process_id` using `CASE WHEN`:

   ```sql
   SELECT machine_id, process_id,
          MAX(CASE WHEN activity_type = 'start' THEN timestamp END) AS start,
          MAX(CASE WHEN activity_type = 'end' THEN timestamp END) AS end
   FROM Activity
   GROUP BY machine_id, process_id
   ```
   - This ensures that for each `process_id`, we only have **one row per process** per machine.

2. **Calculate the average processing time per machine**:
   - Using `table_1`, we compute the **average time** taken per process:

   ```sql
   SELECT machine_id,
          ROUND(AVG(end - start), 3) AS processing_time
   FROM table_1
   GROUP BY machine_id
   ```
   - The difference `(end - start)` gives the **duration of each process**.
   - Using `AVG()` ensures we get the **average processing time per machine**.
   - `ROUND(..., 3)` is used to match the expected precision of three decimal places.

### **Conclusion**
By structuring the query this way, we effectively:
- Extract relevant start and end times for each process within a machine.
- Compute the correct processing time while ensuring **each machineâ€™s processes are considered separately**.
- Utilize subqueries efficiently instead of relying on explicit `JOIN` operations.

This method ensures an **optimized and structured** approach to solving the problem.![img](https://api2.mubu.com/v3/document_image/30352914_de442026-df7a-4e34-80cc-becd52341cfb.png)
