# 197 Rising Temperature

To determine if **tomorrow's temperature is higher than today's**, we can use the special date function **`DATE_ADD()`**. The key idea is to **self-join** the `Weather` table in a way that ensures we only retain rows where both dates exist.

### **Approach**
1. **Use a self-join**:
   - We join `Weather` with itself on the condition that `w1.recordDate` is exactly **one day ahead** of `w2.recordDate`:

   ```sql
   FROM Weather AS w1
   JOIN Weather AS w2
   ON w1.recordDate = DATE_ADD(w2.recordDate, INTERVAL 1 DAY)
   ```
   - This ensures that for each date in `w1`, there exists a corresponding **previous day** in `w2`, keeping only consecutive date pairs.

2. **Filter out cases where tomorrow's temperature is higher**:
   - We apply a `WHERE` condition to select records where **the next day's temperature is greater than the current day's**:

   ```sql
   WHERE w1.temperature > w2.temperature
   ```

### **Conclusion**
By structuring the query this way, we can efficiently find days where the temperature increased compared to the previous day. If this logic is unclear, try manually constructing a small table to visualize the **self-join** and see how only rows where both dates exist are retained.![img](https://api2.mubu.com/v3/document_image/30352914_c2bd1658-01b4-4f8a-9b65-15a77d848632.png)![img](https://api2.mubu.com/v3/document_image/30352914_302f8a41-155d-4412-e4cd-e680aedf8fe3.png)
