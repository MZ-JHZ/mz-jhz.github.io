# 570 Managers with at Least 5 Direct Reports

To determine **managers who have at least 5 direct reports**, we need to analyze the `Employee` table by grouping employees under their respective managers.

### **Approach**
1. **Use a `LEFT JOIN` to self-join the `Employee` table**:
   - We join the table on `managerID` and `id` to associate employees with their respective managers:

   ```sql
   FROM Employee AS e1
   LEFT JOIN Employee AS e2
   ON e1.managerID = e2.id
   ```
   - This ensures that every employee is matched with their corresponding manager.

2. **Group by manager and count direct reports**:
   - We use `GROUP BY` to count the number of employees under each manager:

   ```sql
   GROUP BY e1.managerID
   HAVING COUNT(*) >= 5
   ```

### **Conclusion**
By structuring the query in this way, we can efficiently identify **managers with 5 or more direct reports**, which is useful for organizational analysis and HR reporting.
