# 1068 Customer Orders

To identify customers who **never placed an order**, we need to find records where a customer exists in the `Customers` table but does not have a corresponding entry in the `Orders` table.

### **Approach**
1. **Use a `LEFT JOIN`**:
   - We join `Customers` and `Orders` tables using `customerID`:

   ```sql
   FROM Customers AS c
   LEFT JOIN Orders AS o
   ON c.customerID = o.customerID
   ```
   - Since `Customers` contains all customer records, the `LEFT JOIN` ensures that customers without a matching order will have **NULL** values in the `Orders` table.

2. **Filter out customers with orders**:
   - We select customers **where there is no corresponding order**:

   ```sql
   WHERE o.customerID IS NULL
   ```

### **Conclusion**
By using this query, we correctly extract all customers who **have never placed an order**, ensuring that we do not count customers with even a single order.![img](https://api2.mubu.com/v3/document_image/30352914_0d521cf3-16b3-47ca-de69-1f4971440411.png)
