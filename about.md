title: About me
---

A student in University of Waterloo majoring in FARM(financial analysis and risk management) and statistic who is also really interesting in data analysis.

I have a great passion to apply AI and ML to my data analysis career. The reason why I want to become a data analyst is that I am eager to find the rules hidden in the real world. At the same time, I also found that data is the root of everything. No matter which company it is, they are trying their best to get more data to support and improve their business quality. I really hope to help people and companies make better decisions through data.

I really like playing basketball, guitar and violin. My dream is to be able to dunk one day, so I go to the gym 5 times a week, and 3 times I do squats.

By the way, this website is not all created by myself. Big thanks to leopardpan. This website is based on his work: leopardpan.github.io. Anyone who wants to build a website like this can communicate with me! I am happy to help!
