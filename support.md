title: How I Built My Website Using GitHub Structures
---
My website is based on an open-source GitHub project, which provided the fundamental structure and theme. I found a well-structured repository that aligned with my needs and customized it to fit my personal style and content.

Choosing a GitHub Repository

I explored various GitHub repositories related to personal blogs and documentation sites. Eventually, I selected a template built with Jekyll, as it integrates seamlessly with GitHub Pages and supports Markdown-based content management.

Customization and Setup

To adapt the project to my needs, I:

Forked the original repository and cloned it locally.

Modified the _config.yml file to personalize site settings.

Updated theme styles to match my preferences.

Added and structured my content using Markdown.

Pushed the changes to GitHub and enabled GitHub Pages for deployment.

Lessons Learned

GitHub Pages makes it easy to host a personal website for free.

Jekyllâ€™s structure simplifies content management and customization.

Open-source projects provide a great foundation for building personalized web solutions.

If you are looking to build your own website, exploring GitHub repositories is a great starting point. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions!
