This is a website to record my own learning, including but not limited to python, sql, sas, frm. I hope to show my ability and make more friends through this. This website is based on github: leopardpan.github.io. [leopard](http://leopardpan.cn). Anyone who wants to build a website can communicate with me!

Great Thanks to leopardpan. Again to the source I used ---> leopardpan.github.io
